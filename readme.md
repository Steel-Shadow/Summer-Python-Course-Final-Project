# Summer Python Course Final Project

# Course Resource Platform Recommendation

## Introduction

Given a knowledge graph in the field of computer science, a click on a knowledge node in the knowledge graph will display the recommended courses related to that particular knowledge point.

Sources of courses include:

+ Chinese University MOOC
+ iMOOC
+ iCourse
+ HaoDaXue Online
+ BiliBili
+ Other online course websites (to be found independently, non-paid versions)

## Basic Experiment Requirements

1. Use GUI libraries such as Tkinter, PyQt5, or Python-supported frontend and backend frameworks for GUI design and development.

2. Use Python-related web scraping tools to retrieve resources from the mentioned course platforms, import the neo4j knowledge graph file, and implement functionality such as sorting course resources based on different metrics.

3. The interface should be aesthetically pleasing. Other features can be added as needed, but simplicity and user-friendliness should be ensured first and foremost.

## Required Tasks

1. Develop a web scraping tool for course resources from sources other than the mentioned course learning websites.

2. Import the neo4j knowledge graph file and visualize it. Also, provide a method for deleting existing knowledge graph nodes.

3. A click on a knowledge node in a knowledge graph should display the corresponding course resources, and the resources should be sorted based on different metrics.

4. Implement a user system that includes registration, login, and a user dashboard. The knowledge graph resources should be differentiated based on different users.

## Optional Tasks

1. Perform web scraping on other course sources. Each additional completion earns an extra 2
points (up to maximum of 6 points).

2. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and bookmarking for the knowledge graph.

3. Add other functionalities based on own practicality and workload, and give scores to the functions accordingly
